## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

### Requirements

- ⚠️ PowerToys (v0.37.0 and newer) requires Windows 10 v1903 (18362) or newer.

- Have [.NET Core 3.1.15 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.15-windows-x64-installer). The installer should handle this but we want to directly make people aware.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

#### Stable version

Install from the [Microsoft Store's PowerToys page][microsoft-store-link] or use [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link]. 

- For GitHub, click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup-0.47.0-x64.exe` to download the PowerToys installer.
- For Microsoft Store, you must be using the [new Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsExperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/) which will be available for both Windows 11 and Windows 10.

This is our preferred method.

#### Experimental version
To install the Video Conference mute, please use the [v0.46 experimental version of PowerToys][github-prerelease-link] to try out this version. It includes all improvements from v0.45 in addition to the Video conference utility. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then download the .exe installer.

### Via WinGet (Preview)
Download PowerToys from [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli#installing-the-client). To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

```powershell
WinGet install powertoys
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

## What's Happening

### PowerToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.47 - September 2021 Update

Our goals for the [v0.47 release cycle](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Amicrosoft%2FPowerToys%2F24) primarily centered around stability updates and optimizations, installer updates, general bug fixes, and accessibility improvements.

Notably, based on the community feedback received, PowerToys has re-introduced the highly-requested ability to activate Shortcut Guide via holding the `Win` key. PowerToys also now allows various commands in PowerToys Run to be used in either the universal English phrasing or system-localized translation. The great feedback the community provides is invaluable in helping PowerToys continually grow and improve as a product.

An experimental version of PowerToys (v0.48) will be released the week of October 4th, introducing improvements to our Video Conference Mute utility! All updates from the v0.47.0 release will still apply in v0.48.
