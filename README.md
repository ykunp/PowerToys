```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

## What's Happening

### PowerToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.55 - January 2022 Update

In this release, we are continuing our progress toward getting PowerToys ARM64 ready, fix some top issues and new utilities.  Work from last month helped us enable us to upgrade the code base to .NET 5 and next month onward to .NET 6. This will provide stability and speed improvements.

We're also extremely excited to bring on 3 new PowerToy utilities.

- File Explorer add-on: Developer files for preview pane. This should add about 150 file extensions total. We are using the [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) to power this experience.  Thanks [@aaron-junker](https://github.com/aaron-junker)!
- File Explorer add-on: STL file format thumbnail generation!  Since STL is a common 3D file format, this allows a quick visual check. Thanks [@pedrolamas](https://github.com/pedrolamas)!  Preview pane support is already in Windows.
- Mouse Utility: Crosshair over pointer via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>. This feature was co-developed with the accessibility team at Microsoft. When the team told us about the idea and described trying to find your cursor by looking through a straw, we knew we could leverage code from the other mouse utilities to quickly enable this feature. Below is a quote from one of the testers with a rough validation build:

> "This will change my life and allow me to use any PC without constantly losing the pointer. This is huge! I will be able to work at my normal speed again. It is a total game changer for people with visual field impairments!" â€“ Joanna A.

#### Community
- We would love to directly say THANK YOU. Filing issues and feature requests takes time and we greatly appreciate it. You help us quickly diagnose, spot trends, and prioritize. We love when people fix bugs and develop new PowerToys every little bit does really help.
- [@edwinzap](https://github.com/edwinzap) really helped us validate translation issues when our localization system was in transition.
- [@bdoserror](https://github.com/bdoserror) quickly pointed out a release note error

#### General
- .NET runtime is now on 5, our next release will be upgraded to .NET 6. Moving to .NET 5 and then 6 helped reduce our moving parts in a single release so we went this route.  Why this is important is this is one of the major work items needed for ARM64 support. In addition, this should help provide a speed boosts once we are on .NET 6.
- [@jsoref's](https://github.com/jsoref) spelling plugin help

#### What is being planned for v0.56

For [v0.56][github-next-release-work], we plan on finishing up the .NET upgrade path to 6.  This will require development to migrate to Visual Studio 2022. We are also shifting back to a continuous version number system versus Odd for main and Even for experimental releases.

- .NET 6 upgrade to all available surfaces
- A Dialog on update making you aware of what has changed. 
- 'Shake to activate' find my mouse
- PowerToy Run plugin improvements
